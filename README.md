# Polish

Autonomous "night-shift" code cleanup and refactoring agent.

Polish runs asynchronously in a sandboxed environment to review the day's
changes, refactor messy logic, generate documentation, update dependencies,
and verify results — leaving the codebase clean, tested, and ready for the
next day.

## Core capabilities

- **Persistent AST & code graph observer** — tracks code changes throughout
  the day and maintains an up-to-date structural map of the codebase.
- **Daily "time machine" snapshots** — saves a raw copy of the codebase
  before any nightly cleanup runs (`snapshots/raw/YYYY-MM-DD`).
- **Autonomous night-shift refactoring pipeline** — generates regression
  tests, refactors and deduplicates code, verifies functional parity, and
  updates documentation.
- **Simple CLI** — a single `polish run` command to kick off a nightly pass.

## Status

Early scaffolding — no implementation yet.
